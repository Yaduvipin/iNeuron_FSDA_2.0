1. What does the dollar($) sign do?

Ans=>The dollar sign fixes the reference to a given cell,
 so that it remains unchanged no matter where the formula moves. 
 In other words, using $ in cell references allows you to copy 
 the formula in Excel without changing references.
 example-:$B$4   $=locks column and row
 
 2. How to Change the Reference from Relative to Absolute (or Mixed)?
 
 Ans=> When a formula in a cell is copied to another cell, it changes to match the new cell. 
 In some situations, you may need to have the formula stay the same and not change, 
 which is known as an absolute cell reference.

Changing a cell from a relative to an absolute reference can be done by following the steps below: 

Highlight the cell containing the formula you want to have changed to an absolute or relative reference.
Click the formula box or highlight the formula and press the F4 key to switch between an absolute and relative cell reference.

You can also highlight portions of the formula and press F4 to have a partial absolute reference.



If you want to write manually or create an absolute reference, use the "$" symbol in your formula. Below is a basic example demonstrating the difference between a basic relative and absolute reference.

Relative reference
=SUM(A1:A3)
The above basic formula is one that should be familiar to most users; it adds the values of cells A1 through A3.

Absolute reference
=SUM($A$1:$A$3)
To change the above relative reference to an absolute reference, add a "$" symbol in front of the column and row.

Partial absolute reference
You can also create a partial absolute reference, which allows for flexibility in the formula and functionality in a spreadsheet.

=SUM($A1:$A3)
In this first example, only the column (A) is an absolute reference, while the row is a relative reference. 
When you copy this formula to another column and row, it still references column A, but it changes the row based on where it's copied.

=SUM(A$1:A$3)

In this second example, only the rows (1 through 3) are an absolute reference, while the column is a relative reference.
 When you copy this formula to another column and row, it still references rows 1 through 3,
 but it changes the column based on where it's copied.

3. Explain the order of operations in excel?

Ans=> While  evaluating a formula, Excel follows a standard math protocol called "order of operations". 
In general, Excel's order of operation follows the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication,
 Division, Addition, Subtraction) but with some customization to handle the formula syntax in a spreadsheet. 

First, any expressions in parentheses are evaluated. Parentheses essentially override 
the normal order of operations to ensure certain operations are performed first.

Next, Excel will resolve references. This involves replacing cell references like A1 with the value from the cell,
 as well as evaluating range references like A1:A5,
 which become arrays of values. Other range operations like union (comma) and intersection (space) also happen at this time.

Next, Excel will perform exponentiation, negation, and percent conversions (in that order),
 followed by multiplication and division, addition and subtraction, and concatenation.
 Finally, Excel will evaluate logical operators, if present.

In summary, Excel solves formulas in the following order:

1.Parentheses
2.Reference operators
3.Exponents
4.Negation
5.Percent
6.Multiplication and Division
7.Addition and Subtraction
8.Concatenation
9.Logical operators
Note: If a formula contains multiple operators with the same priority (e.g. multiplication and division,
 or addition and subtraction), Excel will evaluate the operators from left to right.



4. What, according to you, are the top 5 functions in excel and write a basic syntax
for any of two?

Ans=>According to me following are top 5 functions of Excel:
     
	 1. The SUM Function
	 
	 The syntax formula for sum function is “=SUM” (number1, number2, etc.).
	  the sum function for the cells A1 through A7 is obtained through the formula “=SUM(A1:A7)”
	 
	 2. The TEXT Function
	 
	 The syntax formula for text function is “=TEXT” (value, format_text).
     “Value” refers to the particular number you wish to convert to text.
     “Format_text” defines the format of the conversion.
	 
	 3. The VLOOKUP Function
	 
	 The VLookup formula is “=VLOOKUP” (lookup_value, table_array, col_index_num, *range_lookup*).

      “lookup_value” is the data you want to find.
      “table_array” is the data column where you want to limit your search.
      “col_index_num” is the column number within the table that you want to return a value from.
      “range_lookup” is an optional argument that allows you to search for the exact match of your lookup value without sorting the table.
	  
	 4. The AVERAGE Function
	 The syntax formula for the average function is “AVERAGE” (number1, number2, etc.).

      “Number 1” refers to the first number in the range where you want the average.
      “Number 2” is the additional reference of the average range. You can get an average of up to a maximum of 255 cells.
       
	   Examples:
	   
      “=AVERAGE (A2:A10)” – computes the average of numbers in cells A2 through A10.

      “=AVERAGE (B2: B10, 7)” – computes the average of the numbers in cells B2 through B10 and the number 7.


	 5. The CONCATENATE Function
	 
	 The syntax formula for the concatenate function is “CONCATENATE” (text1, [text2…text_n]),

     “Text1, Text2…text_n” are the data you want to combine.
	 
	 
5. When would you use the subtotal function?

Ans=>The SUBTOTAL Function[1]in Excel allows users to create groups and then perform various other Excel functions such as
 SUM, COUNT, AVERAGE, PRODUCT, MAX, etc. Thus, the SUBTOTAL function in Excel helps in analyzing the data provided.

Formula
SUBTOTAL = (method, range1, [range2 …range_n])

Where method is the type of subtotal you wish to obtain

Range1,range2…range_n is the range of cells you wish to subtotal

Why do we need to use SUBTOTALS?
Sometimes, we need data based on different categories. SUBTOTALS help us to get 
the totals of several columns of data broken down into various categories.

For example, let’s consider garment products of different sizes manufactured. 
The SUBTOTAL function will help you to get a count of different sizes in your warehouse.


6. What is the syntax of the vlookup function? Explain the terms in it?

Ans=>
	 The VLookup formula is “=VLOOKUP” (lookup_value, table_array, col_index_num, *range_lookup*).

      “lookup_value” is the data you want to find.
      “table_array” is the data column where you want to limit your search.
      “col_index_num” is the column number within the table that you want to return a value from.
      “range_lookup” is an optional argument that allows you to search for the exact match of your lookup value without sorting the table.
