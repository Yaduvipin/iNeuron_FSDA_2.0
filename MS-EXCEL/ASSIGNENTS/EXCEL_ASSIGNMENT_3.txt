Q1.How and when to use the AutoSum command in excel?

ANS=>The AutoSum command in Excel is a useful tool for quickly adding up
 a range of cells in a worksheet. Here's how and when to use it:

  Select the cell where you want the sum to appear.

  Click on the AutoSum button (Î£) in the Home tab on the Ribbon.

  Excel will automatically select what it thinks is the range of cells 
  you want to add up. If it's correct, simply press Enter to complete the sum.

 If the selected range is not correct, you can adjust it by clicking and
 dragging on the cells you want to include in the sum.

 Alternatively, you can manually enter the cell range for the sum by
 typing "=SUM(" and then selecting the cells you want to add up, followed by 
 closing the bracket with ")" and pressing Enter.

 When to use AutoSum:

 When you want to quickly add up a column or row of numbers without having to type out the formula manually.
 When you need to check your calculations against a built-in Excel function.
 When you want to save time and reduce the risk of errors in your calculations.
 Note: AutoSum will only work if there are numbers in the cells you're trying to add up. If there are any
 empty cells or cells with text, Excel will return an error message.
 
 
Q2. What is the shortcut key to perform AutoSum?

ANS=>The shortcut key to perform AutoSum in Excel is "Alt + =". 
   This shortcut key will automatically select the range of cells that
   Excel thinks you want to add up and insert the SUM formula in the selected cell.
   If the selected range is not correct, you can adjust it by clicking and dragging on 
   the cells you want to include in the sum, and then press Enter to complete the sum.
   
Q3. How do you get rid of Formula that omits adjacent cells?

ANS=>If you have a formula in a cell that omits adjacent cells and you want to include those cells in the formula,
 there are a few steps you can take:

  Select the cell containing the formula that omits adjacent cells.
  Click on the cell's formula bar at the top of the worksheet. This will allow you to edit the formula.
   Edit the formula so that it includes the adjacent cells that were previously omitted. You can do this
   by typing in the cell references or by using the mouse to select the cells.
   Press Enter to save the updated formula.
   
   Alternatively, you can also copy the formula from the original cell and paste it into the adjacent cells that were previously omitted.
   To do this:

   Select the cell containing the formula that omits adjacent cells.
   Press Ctrl + C (Windows) or Command + C (Mac) to copy the formula.
   Select the adjacent cells that you want to include in the formula.
   Right-click on the selected cells and choose "Paste Special" from the menu.
   In the "Paste Special" dialog box, select "Formulas" and click OK.
   This will paste the formula into the adjacent cells, including the references to the cells that were previously omitted.




Q4. How do you select non-adjacent cells in Excel 2016?

ANS=>To select non-adjacent cells in Excel 2016, follow these steps:

    Click on the first cell that you want to select.
    Hold down the Ctrl key (Windows) or Command key (Mac).
    While holding down the Ctrl/Command key, click on each additional cell that you want to select.
	You can click on cells that are not adjacent to each other.
    Release the Ctrl/Command key when you have selected all the cells that you want.
    Alternatively, you can also use the Shift key to select a range of non-adjacent cells:

    Click on the first cell in the range that you want to select.
    Hold down the Shift key.
    While holding down the Shift key, click on the last cell in the range that you want to select.
    Release the Shift key.
    You can then use the Ctrl/Command key to select additional non-adjacent cells, as described in the first method.


Q5. What happens if you choose a column, hold down the Alt key and press the letters
    ocw in quick succession?
	
ANS=>If you hold down the Alt key and press the letters "ocw" in quick succession after choosing a column in a
    Microsoft Excel spreadsheet, it will perform the following actions:

   "o" - It will open the "Column Width" dialog box.
   "c" - It will clear the contents of the selected column.
   "w" - It will adjust the width of the column to fit the contents of the cell(s) within it.
   So, pressing Alt + o + c + w quickly in succession will open the
  "Column Width" dialog box, clear the contents of the selected column,
  and adjust the column width to fit the contents of the cell(s) within it.


Q6. If you right-click on a row reference number and click on Insert, where will the row
    be added?
	
ANS=>	If you right-click on a row reference number in Excel and click on Insert, 
   the new row will be added above the selected row.

   For example, if you right-click on row 5 and select Insert, a new row will be added above row 5,
   and the existing rows will be shifted down. The new row will become row 5, and the row that
   was previously row 5 will become row 6, and so on.

    Similarly, if you select multiple rows and then right-click and select Insert,
	new rows will be inserted above the first selected row, and the existing rows will be shifted down accordingly.
