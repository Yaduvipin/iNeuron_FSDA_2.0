Q1. To use the ribbon commands, what menu and grouping of commands will you
find the Insert and Delete command?

ANS=>The "Insert" and "Delete" commands can be found in the "Cells" menu in the ribbon interface.

   To access these commands, follow the steps below:

   Select the cells or rows/columns that you want to insert or delete.
   Click on the "Home" tab in the ribbon.
   Look for the "Cells" group, which is typically located in the middle of the ribbon.

Q2. If you set a row height or column width to 0 (zero), what happens to the row and
column?

ANS=> In Microsoft Excel, if you set the row height or column width to 0 (zero),
    the row or column will become hidden, but its contents will still remain in the worksheet.

   To set the row height or column width to 0 (zero), follow these steps:

   Select the row(s) or column(s) that you want to hide.
   Right-click on the selected row(s) or column(s) and choose "Row Height" or "Column Width" from the context menu.
   In the "Row Height" or "Column Width" dialog box, enter "0" (zero) in the "Height" or "Width" field.
   Click "OK" to apply the changes.
   After setting the row height or column width to 0 (zero), the row(s) or column(s) will become hidden from view.
  To unhide the row(s) or column(s), you can simply set the row height or column width back to a non-zero 
  value using the same method described above.


Q3. Is there a need to change the height and width in a cell? Why?

ANS=>Yes, there is a need to change the height and width of cells. Here are some reasons why:

1.To fit the contents of the cell: Sometimes, the contents of a cell may not fit within the default size of the cell. By changing the height or width of the cell, you can ensure that all the contents of the cell are visible and not cut off.

2.To improve readability: Changing the height or width of cells can help to improve the readability of a worksheet. By increasing the height of rows and the width of columns, you can make the text and numbers in the cells easier to read.

3.To create a more professional-looking worksheet: By adjusting the height and width of cells, you can make your worksheet look more polished and professional. For example, you can ensure that all the cells are the same size and that the text is aligned properly.

3.To make room for additional data: If you need to add more data to a worksheet, you may need to adjust the height and width of cells to make room for the new data.

In summary, changing the height and width of cells  is important for ensuring that the contents of the cells are visible, improving the readability of the worksheet, creating a more professional-looking worksheet, and making room for additional data.
