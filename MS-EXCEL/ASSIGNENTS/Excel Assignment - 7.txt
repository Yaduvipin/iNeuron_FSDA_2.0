Q3. What is AutoFit and why do we use it?

ANS=>In Microsoft Excel, AutoFit is a feature that automatically adjusts the width or height of a cell, column, or row to fit the content within it.

AutoFit is useful in Excel because it can save time and make your data easier to read and understand. For example, if you have a column of data with varying text lengths, using the AutoFit feature can ensure that all of the text is visible without having to manually adjust the column width for each cell.

To use the AutoFit feature in Excel, simply select the column or row that you want to adjust and double-click on the border of the column or row. Alternatively, you can use the "AutoFit Column Width" or "AutoFit Row Height" option from the "Format" menu or the "Home" tab on the ribbon.

Overall, AutoFit is a helpful tool in Excel that can streamline the formatting process and improve the readability of your data.


Q4. How can you insert new rows and columns into the existing table?

ANS=>You can easily insert new rows and columns into an existing table in Microsoft Excel using the following steps:

Select the row or column where you want to insert the new row or column. To select a column, click on the column letter at the top of the column. To select a row, click on the row number at the left of the row.

Right-click on the selected row or column, and then select "Insert" from the context menu. This will insert a new row or column above or to the left of the selected row or column.

Alternatively, you can use the "Insert" command on the "Home" tab of the ribbon. First, select the row or column where you want to insert the new row or column. Then, click on the "Insert" button in the "Cells" group on the "Home" tab. This will open a dropdown menu where you can select "Insert Sheet Rows" or "Insert Sheet Columns" to insert a new row or column.

If you want to insert multiple rows or columns at once, select the same number of rows or columns as you want to insert. Then, right-click on the selection and choose "Insert" from the context menu or use the "Insert" command on the "Home" tab as described above.

Once you have inserted the new row or column, you can enter data or formulas as usual. The table will automatically adjust to include the new row or column.


Q5. How do you hide and unhide columns in excel?

ANS=>To hide a column in Excel, follow these steps:

Select the column(s) that you want to hide.
Right-click on the selected column(s) and choose "Hide" from the drop-down menu.
Alternatively, you can also use the keyboard shortcut "Ctrl + 0" (zero) to hide the selected column(s).
