Q3. What is freeze panes and why do we use freeze panes? Give
examples.

ANS=>Freeze Panes is a feature in Excel that allows you to lock certain rows and columns of a worksheet in place, making them visible at all times, while you scroll through the rest of the sheet. This can be helpful when you have a large dataset or a long list of information, and you need to keep certain headings or labels visible as you scroll.

To use the Freeze Panes feature in Excel, follow these steps:

Select the cell below and to the right of the rows and columns that you want to freeze.
Go to the View tab and click on Freeze Panes in the Window group.
Select the Freeze Panes option from the drop-down menu.
For example, if you have a large data table with headings in the top row, you can freeze the top row so that the headings remain visible as you scroll through the rest of the table. This can make it easier to navigate and understand the data.

Another example is when you have a worksheet with a lot of information, including a long list of names or products. By freezing the first column of the worksheet, you can keep the names or products visible as you scroll through the rest of the data.

In summary, Freeze Panes is a useful feature in Excel that can make it easier to work with large datasets or long lists of information by allowing you to lock certain rows and columns in place, keeping them visible at all times.

Freeze First Column - This option freezes only the first column of the worksheet. This means that the first column will remain visible as you scroll through the rest of the worksheet.

Freeze Panes by Rows - This option freezes a specific number of rows above the selected cell. This means that the frozen rows will remain visible as you scroll through the rest of the worksheet.

Freeze Panes by Columns - This option freezes a specific number of columns to the left of the selected cell. This means that the frozen columns will remain visible as you scroll through the rest of the worksheet.

You can access these options by selecting the cell below and to the right of the rows and columns that you want to freeze, and then going to the View tab and clicking on the Freeze Panes drop-down menu in the Window group. From there, you can choose the option that best suits your needs.
