    "One key difference between def statements and lambda expressions is that def statements can define functions of \n",

    "1.Keep functions short and focused: Functions should be designed to perform a single, well-defined task.\n",
    "    Avoid creating functions that are too long or try to accomplish too many things.\n",

    "\n",
    "5.Minimize side effects: Functions should not have unexpected side effects that can affect other parts of your code.\n",
    "Make sure your function only modifies the data it is supposed to and doesn't affect other parts of the system.\n",

    "6.Keep error handling in mind: Design functions with error handling in mind. Functions should gracefully handle \n",
    "    errors and return meaningful error messages to the calling code.\n",
