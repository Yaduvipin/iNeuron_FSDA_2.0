    "\n",
    "squares = [x*x for x in range(10)]\n",
    "Enclosing a list comprehension in parentheses creates a generator object. A generator is a type of iterator\n",

    "Generators and iterators are related concepts in Python. In fact, a generator is a specific type of iterator.\n",

    "List comprehensions, on the other hand, use a similar syntax to generate a new list by applying a function to each \n",
